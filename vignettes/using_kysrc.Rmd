The `kysrc` package is primarily a collection of data from the [Kentucky Department of Education's School Report Card website](https://applications.education.ky.gov/src/). Instead of downloading Excel files for each year and category of school report card data, analysts can simply load the `kysrc` package and start exploring data from the 2011-12 school year to the 2015-16 school year.
